I made some updates to [starwars.jayd.ml](https://starwars.jayd.ml).

I added a real backend, and it's not serving static MP3 files anymore. There is 
some JWT trickery happening to make cheating the leaderboard harder; you'd pretty
much have to ID the clips by matching the audio programatically to 'cheat', 
unless there are some esoteric timing attacks I'm not aware of.

Pretty sweet!
