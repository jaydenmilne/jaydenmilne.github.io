title:  "I Finally Fixed My Locales In Arch Linux (Yes I Am Smart)"

For the past 8 months or so I've been using Arch my locales have been kind of
half broken and I couldn't figure out why. I would see output like this:

```sh
$ locale -a
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
C
C.utf8
POSIX
en_US.utf8

$ locale
locale: Cannot set LC_CTYPE to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_MESSAGES to default locale: No such file or directory
locale: Cannot set LC_ALL to default locale: No such file or directory
LANG=en_us.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8
LC_MONETARY="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_NAME="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_ADDRESS="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_TELEPHONE="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_MEASUREMENT="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_us.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```



All the time, even when I ssh-ed into something. I read [the Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale#LANG:_default_locale) 
over and over, checked `/etc/locale.conf`:

```
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LANGUAGE=en_US:en:C
LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8
```

Triple checked I'd uncommented the right things in `/etc/locale.gen`, and `locale-gen` 
over and over, to no avail.

## The Big Clue

Finally after going over every forum and stackoverflow post I could find,
I found [this one](https://superuser.com/questions/1726014/locale-setting-issues-on-arch-linux),
where someone suggests you `unset LANG` and `source /etc/profile.d/locale.sh` to
see if it works.

And it did after I changed that!

```sh
$ unset LANG
$ source /etc/profile.d/locale.sh
$ locale -a
C
C.utf8
POSIX
en_US.utf8
```

So I had been barking up the wrong tree the whole time: my `/etc/locale.conf` 
apparently wasn't the problem.

So what else could it be? 

Well, it turns out KDE overrides your locale somehow, and it was stuck with some
misconfigured value (`en_us.UTF-8` vs `en_US.UTF-8`).

I went to Settings -> Region and Language -> Language -> Modify and "American
English" was listed twice, and there was some kind of error about "American English"
not being supported.

*Artists Rendering of What The List Looked Like:*

> * American English
> * American English
> * C

I deleted both American English entries because I figured one was bugged and 
re-added them. KDE told me to run `local-gen` again, so I did, and rebooted.

```sh
$ locale -a
C
C.utf8
POSIX
en_US.utf8
$ locale
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC=en_US.UTF-8
LC_TIME=en_US.UTF-8
LC_COLLATE=C.UTF-8
LC_MONETARY=en_US.UTF-8
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_PAPER=en_US.UTF-8
LC_NAME=en_US.UTF-8
LC_ADDRESS=en_US.UTF-8
LC_TELEPHONE=en_US.UTF-8
LC_MEASUREMENT=en_US.UTF-8
LC_IDENTIFICATION="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```

Huzzah, this basic thing finally works.

My theory is that I fat fingered `en_us` vs `en_US`  (on two different computers!) 
in `/etc/locale.conf` when installing and fixed it later. KDE however must have
its own locale mechanism, and kept the bugged entry stored somewhere until I 
went and cleared it out. Oof.
