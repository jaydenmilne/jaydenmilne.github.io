In my [recent analysis of YouTube's information density ]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2025-04-30-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses.md %}) I included the results from
an advanced statistical analysis on the number of videos present on the home
page, which projected that around May 2026 there would only be one lonely video 
on the home screen.

Amazingly, a disgruntled Googler [leaked a recording of how YouTube's PM 
org handled the criticism](https://youtu.be/_tZckjQylGU?t=25) as it sat at the
[top of Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43846487) for a whole 
day for some reason.

The net result is that after months of hard work by ~~Gemini~~ YouTube engineers
, the other day I fired up YouTube on an Apple TV and was graced with this:

<img alt="there is only one ad and one video visible" src="/assets/posts/2025-11-10-someone-at-youtube-needs-glasses-part-ii/prophecy.jpg">

Let's analyze this picture and count the number of videos on the home screen:

Unfortunately the YouTube PM org's myopia is accelerating: with this data I now 
project that there will be zero videos on the homescreen around May of 2026 now, 
up from September.

Apparently [Poe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) applies to 
Google PMs, satire is dead, and maybe our mandatory NeuraLinks are coming sooner 
than I thought.
