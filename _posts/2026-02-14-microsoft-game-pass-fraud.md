title:  "Microsoft Game Pass Ultimate Billing Fraud"

I purchased an Xbox Series X out of some misplaced sense of nostalgia for the 
360 and because I needed a 4K player. At the time you could still do the trick
where you load up on Xbox Live Gold and then convert it to Game Pass Ultimate
cheaply.

I signed up for it and then **made absolutely sure to disable any autorenewing settings everywhere I could.** I remember  seeing something to the effect of "Your subscription will
expire 2/2026 and will not renew.

At the time I still trusted Microsoft a little, but I made sure to use a one
time use credit card number, just in case.

Lo and behold, I just got this email:

Conveniently for those liars and cheats at Microsoft, *somehow* in the intervening
three years autorenew got turned back on. Oopsie whoopsie sowwy 👉👈!

I don't know how this isn't outright fraud.
