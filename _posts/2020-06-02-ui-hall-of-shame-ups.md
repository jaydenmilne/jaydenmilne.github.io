Even UPS isn't immune from bad UI.

Open a link to track a package, of the format `https://www.ups.com/track?loc=en_US&tracknum=DEADBEEFCAFEBABE00`

The page is automatically redirected to `https://www.ups.com/track?loc=en_US&tracknum=DEADBEEFCAFEBABE00/trackdetails`

Press refresh, or try and share the link with someone:

Nice job.
