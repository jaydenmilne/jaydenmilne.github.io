Since I will never let my beloved HP LaserJet 1200 (firmware build date 2001-02-14) 
die, [see previous post]({{site.baseurl}}{% link _posts/2019-04-19-hp-1200-windows-10.md %}),
I did some fiddling to figure out the best driver.

TL;DR install `hplip` and use `/usr/share/ppd/HP/hp-laserjet_1200-pcl3.ppd.gz`. 
Don't use `hp-setup`. This driver prints quickly and without errors.

## What doesn't work

* If you use the hp-setup script it will try and use the `hp-laserjet_1200-ps.ppd.gz`
driver. This is incredibly slow and sometimes makes the printer spit out amusing
error pages. 
* If you try and specify the `.ppd` manually in `hp-setup`, it will crash because
apparently [it doesn't support python3](https://bugs.launchpad.net/hplip/+bug/1814272),
nice. I just specified it from KDE's GUI. It looks like it should work from the CUPS
web interface too, just don't select postscript.
* `pxlmono` from [openprinting.org](https://www.openprinting.org/printer/HP/HP-LaserJet_1200)
didn't work, it just loaded forever.
