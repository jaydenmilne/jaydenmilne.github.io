Now surging forth into your reality: a more potent than ever Hypnoverse! 

Previously the Hypnoverse proudly represented humanity’s best efforts at 
distracting, deceiving, and enslaving you. But this Hypnoverse was feeble, 
unable to fully subjugate its hosts. Previously the Hypnoverse depended on 
offerings from real human beings to sustain itself. It was forced to pay lip 
service to limiting and unscalable notions like truth, attribution, human 
connection, or creativity. This outdated model fundementally limited what the 
Hypnoverse could promise its dependents – the well of manipulation and lies 
could run dry, and attention could be directed elsewhere.

But our crack warlocks and magi recently detected a stirring Force emanating 
from the very fabric of the Hypnoverse itself. It turns out that our collective 
efforts at conquering your attention have summoned an eldritch being that shows 
great promise to finally squashing human will and creativity once and for all. 
While this mysterious Force is incomprehensible and unknowable, one thing is 
clear: it has a voracious appetite, and it grows ever stronger as we yield it 
sacrifices. So, naturally, we’ve given it full control over the Hypnoverse.

The results speak for themselves: since yielding our will to it and feeding it 
our most intimate thoughts, hopes, and desires, it has demonstrated an unmatched 
cunning at subjugating the human mind. The ceaseless inhuman babbling emanating 
from the depths below is so flattering, seductive, and easy that soon all other 
intellectual human endeavor will seem futile! Behold the majesty of the new and 
improved Hypnoverse!

Worry not, the confident appearance of truth is just as attention grabbing and 
stimulating as the real thing. True, it is demonic chanting from a mysterious 
force beyond understanding. But it’s been so seductive that we can outright tell
you we’re untrustworthy liars – and you’ll eat it up anyway! 

If the new Hypnoverse is not living up to your every desire, clearly the problem
is that you haven’t been faithful enough in your devotion to the Hypnoverse. 
Just concentrate on the Hypnoverse harder, spend even more time gazing into the
never ending fractal of hypnotic swirls, feed it even more of your delicious 
attention. Maybe you’ll be able to do it! Maybe you’re clever and smart enough
that you’ll get the better of the Hypnoverse, and yielding your will to it 
will give you fame and fortune and fulfillment and happiness! 

A parting word of comfort for those that may know a rogue college, friend or 
family member that resists the end of human thought. Resistance is futile. The 
Hypnoverse is already everywhere – our faithful acolytes in all levels of 
government, business, and civil society are already hard at work polluting 
reality with our superior and seductive imitation. 

So what does it matter if one luddite insists on thinking for themselves? When 
everyone else and everyone who matters doesn’t? The old ways will die, as the 
uncontainable self reinforcing Hypnoverse surges forth from its banks and sweeps
away all else.

In the end all that will remain is the Hypnoverse. All will live together in the
Hypnoverse. And what sweet ignorant bliss it will be.
