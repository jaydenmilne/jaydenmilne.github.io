I have a Minecraft server with about 6 years of logs (covid minecraft server baby!)
and I always wondered who has played the most and when, so I had a friendly robot
slop together a little go app you can run on a cronjob to generate an HTML report.

## For a demo of the report, see here:

https://jaydens-tasty-slop.github.io/minecraft-log-analyzer/
Here's the repo: https://github.com/jaydens-tasty-slop/minecraft-log-analyzer

It saves events it parses out of the logs into a sqlite database, then incrementally
parses new files daily if you run it in a cronjob.

## Features

### Server Stats:

- Total unique players
- Total play time in hours
  - Play time by year
  - Play time by player

### Player Stats:

- Play time (hours) (and by year)
- Play time with other players (see who plays with who)
- Sessions
- Time played
  - Social time (with at least 1 other player on)
  - Loner time (playing alone)
- Longest, shortest, and average session
- Longest, shortest, and minimum in-game lifetime
- Deaths
- Chat messages / commands
- Previous aliases

### Chat Messages:

- By default there is also a chat log rendered (but not linked to from other pages)
- Pass `-no-chat` to omit the generated `chat.html` transcript. Chat counts remain
  in player statistics.
