I'm proud to announce the launch of an inside joke tht I spend way too much
time on: Bean Farming Simulator 2025.

Have you ever wanted to have an infinitely scrollable virtual beanfield in the
web3 metaverse to tend and care to? Do you yearn for maximum realism in your
hypothetical bean simulator, such that it takes roughtly 55 days for your bean
bushes to mature? 

Such a project doesn't exist, but there is Bean Farming Simulator 2025 that
gets close.

* Infinitely scrollable (until coordinates around 10,000,000 where things start
  to break down)
* Stunning isometric graphics (thanks to [kenny.nl](kenny.nl))
* Beans take 55-60 days to mature, but
* Easily create a calendar reminder in Google Calendar or Apple Calendar/others
  (ics file)
* Sell beans to earn money
* Install as a Progressive Web App for offline use
* Custom loading screen that functions as a tutorial too
* Subtle chromatic abberation vignette

## But Seriously Why

Just wanted a little project to continue experimenting with Godot. I've been
quite pleased with it so far, it's nice to work with. This was also my first
foray into using free asset packs, since I have no art skills to speak of.

For some reason I enjoy making these dumb little static website projects that I
can ship and forget about for months. Then I remember and can self-congratulate
myself on shipping something. I like web apps because it's so easy to pull them
up anywhere and show anyone.
