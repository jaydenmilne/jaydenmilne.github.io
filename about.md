A quick technical blog to either explain things that took me too long to figure 
out and that I can't find in other places, or to shout into the void about 
things that annoy me. This is my blog, I blog what I want here.

The quality level of this stuff is questionable at best. 

I make no warranty as to the accuracy, entertainment value, or legality of my 
advice. These are my opinions and not my employer's.
